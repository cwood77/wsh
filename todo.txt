parity with bash for db dev
[ ] pipes, redirection, and &&
[ ] colorized output
[ ] use peekpipe to try to fix pipe reading race
[ ] git help

nice to have for db dev
[ ] keystroke help
[ ] script language
[ ] command - setAlias command
[ ] command - setHelp command
[ ] copy/paste

later
[ ] hint text (history completion)
[ ] tar help
[ ] macros
[ ] timestamped output
[ ] 'explicit' command that means no resolving?
[ ] command - ver command
[ ] command - dir-like command
[ ] command - cd
[ ] command - pushd/popd

deferred but not rejected
[ ] decide which commands are internal and which are not
[ ] tab completion is based on userText, so input with multiple paths will be ambiguous?

done
[x] code review 5/6/23
[x] tab completion (file browsing)
