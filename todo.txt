to replace bash as git shell

new, uncategorized

nice to have for db dev
[ ] paste from clipboard
[ ] gvim command for launching VIM with 'start'
[ ] git help
[ ] colorized output for make
[ ] keystroke help
[ ] script language
[ ] command - setAlias command
[ ] command - setHelp command

later
[ ] use peekpipe to try to fix pipe reading race
[ ] pipes
[ ] redirection (< and >)
[ ] hint text (history completion)
[ ] tar help
[ ] macros
[ ] timestamped output
[ ] 'explicit' command that means no resolving?
[ ] command - ver command
[ ] command - dir-like command
[ ] command - cd
[ ] command - pushd/popd

deferred but not rejected
[ ] decide which commands are internal and which are not
[ ] tab completion is based on userText, so input with multiple paths will be ambiguous?

                 end '                  -30       -128       -103
[x] colorized output for make stderr
[x] && with commands doesn't put the whole thing in history, just parts
